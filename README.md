# Rules-for-scholar
This ruleset contains the common academic databases at home and abroad, and provides  **PAC** and **Surge** formats  for use.

This ruleset helps you to switch the proxy rules automatically of your website browser like [SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega) or proxy software like [Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash), Surge(for Mac & iOS), Surfboard(for Android) etc. Therefore, you can get the access to view the scholar website by the proxy network of your institute and switch them easily.
